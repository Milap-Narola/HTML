            Harvard University classmates Bill Gates and Paul Allen <br>started Microsoft in 1975 to
            develop
            a compiler <br> for the Altair 8800, a very primitive early computer. <br> Gates contacted
            the
            manufacturer <br>Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) <br> and offered to
            write a
            program for the new computer. <br>Gates and Allen created an interpreter for <br> BASIC --
            which was
            then a mainframe programming language -- to use with the Altair.

            Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak,<br> Steve
            Jobs and
            Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple <br> I personal computer. It was
            incorporated by
            Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer,<br> Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the
            Apple II,<br>
            became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers.<br> Apple went
            public in
            1980 to instant financial success. <br> The company developed computers featuring innovative
            <br>
            graphical user interfaces,<br> including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year
            <br> in a
            critically acclaimed advertisement called "1984". <br> By 1985, the high cost of its
            products, and <br>
            power struggles between executives, <br> caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple
            and pursued <br>
            other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, <br> taking some Apple employees with
            him.

            Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue,<br> Washington,[6] on July 5,
            1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, <br> it has expanded into a multitude of
            product
            categories,<br> a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store. <br> [7] It
            has
            multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing),<br>Zoox (autonomous
            vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet),<br> and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware
            R&D).
            Its other subsidiaries include Ring, <br>Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its
            acquisition
            of Whole Foods in August 2017 <br>for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint
            <br> as a
            physical retailer.[8]

            The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003,<br> by Martin Eberhard
            and
            Marc Tarpenning.[12] <br> [13] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO,
            respectively.[14] <br>
            Eberhard said that he wanted to build "a car manufacturer <br>that is also a technology
            company", <br>with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software,<br> and the
            proprietary motor".[15] <br>
            Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[12] <br> In February
            2004, the
            company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2022) <br> in series A funding,
            including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2022) <br> Elon Musk, who had received
            $100 million from the sale of his interest <br> in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the
            chairman of the board of directors <br>and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[16][17][14] J.
            B.
            Straubel <br>joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18]
